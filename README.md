This project is totally based on CodeCrafters API.

A react web app to generate an m3u playlist for the channels Available on Tata Sky.

## Update

2) Open cmd / terminal and type the below commands one by one.<br>
a) npm install<br>
b) npm run dev

## Note : **use this playlist on OTT Navigator and set to reload data to 2 to 4 hours, Bcz key expires in 4 to 24 hours for most of channels.
